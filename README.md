You can change this location at any time and see yaks from different colleges.

```*Choose New Location		(L) or (L <location>)```

## Getting Yaks to Show Up

```R``` retrieves the latest yaks from your location.

```T``` retrieves the highest upvoted yaks from your location.

```B``` retrieves the highest upvoted yaks from anywhere.

```S``` retrieves your own yaks.

```O``` retrieves your own replies to yaks.

## Posting

To start a post, enter ```P```

You can specify a handle for a post and choose whether to show location:

    Enter message to yak: 
    Good morning!
    Add handle: (Blank to omit): 
    Friendly Yakker
    Show location? (Y/N) Y
    
Using the parameter allows for quicker posting:

```-> P Good Morning!```

## Commenting

You specify the number of the yak, which is in the top-left corner:

    _____________________________________________________________________________________________
    31

    Losing your wallet is like losing a part of your soul.
    
Comment: ```-> C 31```

```Enter comment:```
    
Same for upvoting a yak: ```-> U 31```

Downvoting a yak: ```-> D 31```

Upvoting a comment requires the yak number as well as the comment number to the left of the dashed line.
